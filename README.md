# Analysis of Employee Exit Surveys

The objective of this report is to analyse employee exit survey data from the [Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey) and the [Technical and Further Education (TAFE)](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) institute in Queensland, Australia to answer the following questions:
1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?;
2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

This project was completed as part of the "Data Cleaning and Analysis" course by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/course/python-datacleaning/).
